# Lung Cancer Detection Using EfficientNet-B3
This project implements a deep learning model for classifying lung cancer types using EfficientNet-B3 architecture. The model can distinguish between three classes:

Adenocarcinoma: The most common type of lung cancer arising from glandular cells lining the airways.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma: The second most common type, arising from squamous cells lining the airways.
Benign Tissue: Representing healthy lung tissue for comparison.
