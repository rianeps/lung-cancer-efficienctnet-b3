# Lung Cancer Type Prediction Using EfficientNet-B3
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the type of lung cancer from histopathological images using the EfficientNet-B3 model. The dataset includes images of three types of lung tissues: 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Benign Tissue', and 'Squamous Cell Carcinoma'.

## Dataset

### Classes
- **Adenocarcinoma**: The most common type of lung cancer, arising from the glandular cells that line the airways of the lungs.
- **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: The second most common type of lung cancer, arising from the squamous cells that line the airways of the lungs.
- **Benign Tissue**: Healthy lung tissue used for comparison with the cancerous tissues.

### Image Details
- **Type**: Histopathological images
- **Dimensions**: 768 x 768 pixels
- **Format**: JPEG

## Model

### EfficientNet-B3
EfficientNet-B3 is a convolutional neural network model that scales up the width, depth, and resolution of the network in a principled way. It is known for its efficiency and performance in image classification tasks.
